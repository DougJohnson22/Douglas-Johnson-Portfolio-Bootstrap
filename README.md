# Douglas-Johnson-Portfolio-Bootstrap

## Welcome to my Portfolio Page!
On this website you will find a breif introduction to my history before enrolling in the Bootcamp. On each page you will find the Nav bar that highlights the active page and the foot that sticks to the bottom of your view screen. Located on the footer are two social media icons that lead to my related social media accounts when clicked. Below are examples of my code work to demonstrate how I was able to achieve the sticky footer and the use of sub divisions on my portfolio page in order to display the images as a series of rows and colums.
